## 🚀 Features

- **Three-Step Response Process**:
  1. **Analysis**: Examines user queries for clarity and completeness.
  2. **Rethinking**: Critically evaluates and suggests improvements to initial responses.
  3. **Refinement**: Delivers a final, polished response integrating all insights.
- **Elegant User Interface**: A clean, responsive design enhances the user experience.
- **Conversation History**: Keep track of your chat history within the session.
- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitors and displays the time taken for each response.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MOHAMED-EL-HADDIOUI/GPT-4o-mini.git
   cd GPT-4o-mini
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🖥 Usage

3. Enter your query in the text input field and click "Submit" to interact with Echo-Refraction.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a query in the provided text field.
2. **Analysis**: GPT-4o mini analyzes the query for clarity and completeness.
3. **Initial Response**: An initial response is generated based on the analysis.
4. **Rethinking**: The initial response is critically evaluated for potential improvements.
5. **Refinement**: A final, polished response is created, incorporating all insights and suggestions.
6. **Display**: The entire process, including analysis, rethinking, and final response, is displayed to the user.

## 🎨 Customization

- Modify the `prompts` dictionary in `app.py` to adjust the behavior of the analysis, rethinking, and refinement stages.
